# Decision-Tree-Classifier-and-Clustering
Yet another project in CSC 869 Data Mining for partial completion of the class in San Francisco State University.

## Technologies Used:
Python, Weka, PyCharm by IntelliJ.

## Dataset:
Census income dataset for Part 1.
Iris dataset for Part 2.

## Description:
C4.5 classifier and Clustering. Using the classifier readily available in Weka or Scikit-learn, apply the same classification to the census income adult dataset. Then comparing the results to the Naive Bayesian classifier implemented by me (Check my repos). 
Apply various clustering algorithms on a small but perfect dataset - IRIS. 

#### Clustering algorithms used:
1. Simple K Means
2. X Means
3. DBSCAN - A density based clustering algorithm.
